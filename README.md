**POWER SYSTEM FAULT DETECTION**
Despite advancements in power system monitoring, there is no widely adopted intelligent solution that can accurately and rapidly detect and classify all types of faults (e.g., line-to-ground, line-to-line, three-phase) in power distribution systems using real-time electrical measurements.
Existing methods rely heavily on manual inspection or fixed threshold-based techniques, which are often inaccurate, slow, and not scalable. This lack of an intelligent, data-driven fault diagnosis system poses a major risk to grid stability and reliability.
